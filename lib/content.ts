  story: [
    "In the 1990s, Ajay Handa was building a bar inside his family's hotel in Hubli and ran out of money before he could hire a bartender. He drove 400 kilometres to Bangalore, spent days shadowing bartenders at the city's top venues, came back, trained two local boys in everything he had learned, and opened The Zebra Crossing, North Karnataka's first youth nightlife venue.",
    'Three decades later, the same instinct drives Devo Edutech. Ajay identified that 40 million frontline hospitality workers across Tier 2 and Tier 3 India had never had access to practical, vernacular, job-ready training. No one was building for Bharat. So he did.',
    "Ajay brings deep roots in Karnataka's hospitality, logistics, and startup ecosystem. He is a Toastmasters Presentation Mastery alumnus, a Startup Karnataka Elevate grant winner, and a practitioner whose understanding of India's real hospitality industry shapes every decision at Hotelwaley.",
